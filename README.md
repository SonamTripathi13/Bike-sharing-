## Problem Statement

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has been facing a significant decline in revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is struggling to sustain itself in the current market and is looking for a comprehensive business plan to accelerate its revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.

The company wants to analyze and understand:

- **Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?**
- **How well those variables describe bike demand and profits?**

## Business Goal

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

### 1. **Assessing Post-Quarantine Shared Bike Demand**
   - Evaluate the anticipated demand for shared bikes once the COVID-19 quarantine ends nationwide.

### 2. **Identifying Key Revenue Factors**
   - Identify the significant variables that influence revenue from shared bike usage.
   - Understand which factors are most predictive of bike demand.

### 3. **Evaluating Model Accuracy**
   - Assess how accurately the selected variables explain and predict the demand for shared bike usage.
